00:00:15,411 --> 00:00:16,541
Hi.

3
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,071
I've got a question for you:

4
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:21,351
how many people here
would say they can draw?

5
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:23,751
(Laughter)

6
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:27,291
I think we've got about one or two percent
of the hands going up,

7
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:28,801
and it's interesting, isn't it?

8
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:33,311
It's a little bit like people think
of spelling or singing.

9
00:00:33,311 --> 00:00:36,771
They think,"You can either
do it, or you can't."

10
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:38,651
But I think you can.

11
00:00:38,651 --> 00:00:40,565
Because when people say they can't draw,

12
00:00:40,565 --> 00:00:44,285
I think it's more to do with beliefs
rather than talent and ability.

13
00:00:44,285 --> 00:00:48,065
So I think when you say you can't draw,
that's just an illusion,

14
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:50,785
and today I'd like to prove that to you.

15
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:52,295
When I say "draw",

16
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:55,265
I'm not saying we're all going
to draw like Michelangelo.

17
00:00:55,265 --> 00:00:58,765
We are not going to be painting
the Sistine Chapel's ceiling.

18
00:00:58,765 --> 00:01:02,225
But would you be happy if,
by the end of this session,

19
00:01:02,225 --> 00:01:05,525
you could draw pictures
a little bit like this?

20
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:06,955
(Audience murmuring) Oh, yes!

21
00:01:06,955 --> 00:01:07,855
(Laughter)

22
00:01:07,855 --> 00:01:11,485
Or even a little bit like this?

23
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:12,465
(Laughter)

24
00:01:12,465 --> 00:01:16,335
Actually, there are only two things
you need to do to be able to achieve this.

25
00:01:16,335 --> 00:01:18,545
One is have an open mind.
Are you up for that?

26
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:19,475
(Audience) Yes!

27
00:01:19,475 --> 00:01:22,035
And two, just be prepared to have a go.

28
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:24,245
So grab a pen and a piece of paper.

29
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:40,811
OK, so here's how it's going to work:

30
00:01:41,336 --> 00:01:43,676
I’ll show you the first cartoon
we're going to do,

31
00:01:43,676 --> 00:01:45,496
so just watch to begin with.

32
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:46,900
Here we go.

33
00:01:47,227 --> 00:01:48,527
Just watching.

34
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:56,949
That's going to be our first cartoon.

35
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:58,549
It's a character called Spike.

36
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:00,509
I'd like you to draw along with me.

37
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,929
I'll draw the first line, you draw,
and when you've done that, look up,

38
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:06,279
and I'll know you're ready
for the next line.

39
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:08,026
Okay, here we go.

40
00:02:08,026 --> 00:02:10,256
Start with the nose.

41
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:16,949
Now the eyes.

42
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:20,748
They're like 66s or speech marks.

43
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:26,023
That's it.

44
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:29,521
Next, the mouth. Nice, big smile.

45
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:35,791
Now, over here, the ear.

46
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,480
Next, some spiky hair.

47
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:50,270
Next, put the pen to the left
to the mouth, little line like that.

48
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:55,301
Pen under the ear, drop a line like that.

49
00:02:57,031 --> 00:03:00,411
Pen to the left of the neck,
top of the T-shirt.

50
00:03:01,487 --> 00:03:04,497
Line to the left, line to the right.

51
00:03:04,497 --> 00:03:06,677
Just hold your drawings up
and show everyone.

52
00:03:06,677 --> 00:03:07,527
(Laughter)

53
00:03:07,527 --> 00:03:08,757
How are we all doing?

54
00:03:08,757 --> 00:03:10,807
(Laughter)

55
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,488
OK.

56
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,760
OK, fantastic.

57
00:03:22,122 --> 00:03:26,542
So, it looks like you've just learned
to draw one cartoon,

58
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:28,722
but you've actually learned
more than that;

59
00:03:28,722 --> 00:03:30,922
you've learned a sequence
that would enable you

60
00:03:30,922 --> 00:03:33,742
to draw hundreds and thousands
of different cartoons,

61
00:03:33,742 --> 00:03:37,542
because we're just going to do
little variations on that sequence.

62
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:38,542
Have a go at this.

63
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:40,272
Draw along with me.

64
00:03:40,272 --> 00:03:41,942
Nose.

65
00:03:45,944 --> 00:03:48,024
Eyes.

66
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,323
Smile.

67
00:03:57,527 --> 00:03:58,787
That's it.

68
00:03:58,787 --> 00:04:00,802
Now some hair.

69
00:04:05,724 --> 00:04:08,024
Pen to the left of the mouth,

70
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:12,841
under the hair,

71
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:15,599
little V-shape for the top,

72
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,508
line to the left, line to the right.

73
00:04:19,508 --> 00:04:22,208
So we've got another character.
Let's call her Thelma.

74
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,258
(Laughter)

75
00:04:23,258 --> 00:04:24,818
So, we've got Spike and Thelma.

76
00:04:24,818 --> 00:04:27,248
Let's try another one. Here we go.

77
00:04:27,248 --> 00:04:29,818
Another little variation.
You're getting the idea.

78
00:04:29,818 --> 00:04:32,048
Starting with the nose.

79
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,980
But this time we'll change
the eyes slightly.

80
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,490
Look, two circles together like that.

81
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,280
That's it.

82
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,490
Then, two little dots in for the eyes.

83
00:04:46,524 --> 00:04:49,684
And this time we'll change
the mouth slightly. Watch.

84
00:04:49,692 --> 00:04:51,522
Little circle colored in there.

85
00:04:52,197 --> 00:04:54,177
Have a go at that.

86
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,860
Next, the ear.

87
00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:03,231
Now, we'll have some fun
with the hair, watch.

88
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:05,201
Nice curly hair.

89
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:13,521
Then same thing: pen to the left
to the mouth, little line like that.

90
00:05:14,251 --> 00:05:16,721
Under the ear, drop a line.

91
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,160
Top of the T-shirt.

92
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:22,543
Line to the left, line to the right.

93
00:05:22,543 --> 00:05:24,223
I think we'll call him Jeff.

94
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,790
(Laughter)

95
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,570
We'll do one more.

96
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,481
One more go. Here we go.

97
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:31,751
You're getting the idea.

98
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:32,531
(Laughter)

99
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:35,241
So we'll start with a nose again.

100
00:05:36,952 --> 00:05:38,722
Notice we're doing little variations.

101
00:05:38,722 --> 00:05:41,152
Now we'll change the eyes,
so we've got them apart.

102
00:05:41,152 --> 00:05:43,642
We'll put some little dots in like that.

103
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:49,193
Next, the mouth slightly different.

104
00:05:49,193 --> 00:05:52,303
Let's put a little V-shape like that.

105
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:54,531
Triangle.

106
00:05:54,531 --> 00:05:57,860
And a little line across,
and we'll just color this a little bit in.

107
00:06:01,996 --> 00:06:04,236
Now, watch this bit carefully;
some hair, watch.

108
00:06:04,236 --> 00:06:06,376
Here we go, little line like that.

109
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,770
Next, a bit more there.

110
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:18,951
And watch, a couple of triangles
to make a little bow.

111
00:06:23,018 --> 00:06:26,058
Triangle at the bottom, rest of the hair.

112
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:32,501
Pen to the left of the mouth again.
You get the idea.

113
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,200
Drop a line for the neck.

114
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:39,511
Now the V-shape.

115
00:06:41,238 --> 00:06:44,548
Line to the left, line to the right.

116
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,138
There we go.

117
00:06:46,485 --> 00:06:47,945
Let's call her Pam.

118
00:06:47,945 --> 00:06:49,015
(Laughter)

119
00:06:49,015 --> 00:06:50,005
So you've done...

120
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:52,045
(Laughter)

121
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:56,615
So you've done four cartoons.
You can have a little rest now.

122
00:06:56,615 --> 00:06:57,565
(Laughter)

123
00:06:57,565 --> 00:06:58,735
Take a rest.

124
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:01,645
You're getting the idea.
All we're doing is little variations.

125
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,535
I'll just demonstrate a couple to you.

126
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:05,285
We could go on all day, couldn't we?

127
00:07:05,285 --> 00:07:07,825
You could do someone
looking unhappy, a bit like that,

128
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:11,525
or you could experiment with,
perhaps, someone who is…

129
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:14,755
just draw a straight line,
someone looking a bit fed up.

130
00:07:14,755 --> 00:07:18,165
Or perhaps, you could do anything
you like, really, just try things out.

131
00:07:18,165 --> 00:07:21,535
Look at this. Little squiggle.
There we are.

132
00:07:21,535 --> 00:07:23,515
So, all sorts of things we could do.

133
00:07:23,515 --> 00:07:25,985
Actually, one more I'll let you do,
one more idea.

134
00:07:25,985 --> 00:07:28,845
This is a great little technique.

135
00:07:29,203 --> 00:07:31,513
Have a go at this: people with glasses on.

136
00:07:31,513 --> 00:07:34,763
Just draw a nose a bit like Spike's.

137
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,030
Next, draw some frames,

138
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,010
so two circles like that
with a little bit in between.

139
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:47,496
Now, just put some dots
inside for the eyes like that.

140
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,258
Next, the ear.

141
00:07:51,258 --> 00:07:56,628
So it's little bit like we did before,
but this time we'll join up the frames.

142
00:07:57,065 --> 00:07:58,665
That's it. Watch this bit.

143
00:08:01,513 --> 00:08:03,303
(Laughter)

144
00:08:03,718 --> 00:08:06,118
And this bit I really like. Watch.

145
00:08:07,024 --> 00:08:09,504
(Laughter)

146
00:08:09,504 --> 00:08:12,044
And then, little bit there.

147
00:08:13,252 --> 00:08:16,522
Pencil under the mustache, line down,

148
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:20,537
top of the shirt, left and right.

149
00:08:20,922 --> 00:08:23,752
So there we have it.
We could carry on, couldn't we?

150
00:08:23,752 --> 00:08:25,982
Hopefully, we've done enough
to convince you

151
00:08:25,982 --> 00:08:29,502
that in fact we can all draw.

152
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:33,502
And not just people here.
I've worked with…

153
00:08:33,502 --> 00:08:38,522
I'm going to give you three examples
of other people who've learned to draw,

154
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:40,762
and that actually surprised them, too.

155
00:08:40,762 --> 00:08:43,752
I'm going to save
what I think is my favorite,

156
00:08:43,752 --> 00:08:46,302
most surprising example until last.

157
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,782
The first example is:

158
00:08:48,782 --> 00:08:51,752
I've worked a lot with children
and students in schools.

159
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:54,002
Actually the little ones,
they just draw fine,

160
00:08:54,002 --> 00:08:57,582
but when they get to about 15 or 16,
most of them think they can't draw.

161
00:08:57,582 --> 00:08:58,782
But I worked with them.

162
00:08:58,782 --> 00:09:00,912
I worked this week in a school

163
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:04,242
where I was coaching them
on using pictures for memory.

164
00:09:04,242 --> 00:09:08,262
A girl was trying to remember
what red blood cells do,

165
00:09:08,262 --> 00:09:09,862
and she drew this little picture

166
00:09:09,862 --> 00:09:13,242
of a red blood cell
carrying a handbag with O2 on it

167
00:09:13,242 --> 00:09:17,802
to remind her that the red blood cells
carry oxygen to all parts of the body.

168
00:09:17,802 --> 00:09:19,252
That was a great one.

169
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:22,552
The other people I worked with
are many adults in all walks of life,

170
00:09:22,552 --> 00:09:24,782
and particularly in business,

171
00:09:24,782 --> 00:09:28,232
and they often will want
to make presentations memorable.

172
00:09:28,232 --> 00:09:32,242
So again, a quick cartoon or sketch
could be really good for that.

173
00:09:32,242 --> 00:09:36,282
And again, most people think
they can't draw, but take this example.

174
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:38,022
Couple of wavy lines,

175
00:09:41,062 --> 00:09:46,942
little boat could be a metaphor
to represent we're all in this together.

176
00:09:46,942 --> 00:09:49,782
So that, if that was just drawn
in the presentation,

177
00:09:49,782 --> 00:09:52,242
would really stay
in the memory, wouldn't it?

178
00:09:52,242 --> 00:09:53,082
Yeah.

179
00:09:53,082 --> 00:09:56,292
But the third example is -
you shouldn't have favorites, should you?

180
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:58,042
This is my favorite.

181
00:09:58,042 --> 00:10:01,262
Have you ever been at the party
when someone asks you what you do?

182
00:10:01,262 --> 00:10:03,852
It gets a little bit skeptical
when people ask me that.

183
00:10:03,852 --> 00:10:05,772
This lady said to me, well -

184
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:09,012
I said, "I do a little bit of training,
and I teach people to draw,"

185
00:10:09,012 --> 00:10:13,472
and she said, "Would you come along
and do some for our group?"

186
00:10:13,472 --> 00:10:16,542
She said, "I work with some people"
- she was a volunteer -

187
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:19,292
a group of people
who have suffered strokes.

188
00:10:19,292 --> 00:10:22,472
So I said, "Sure, I could spare
some time for that."

189
00:10:22,472 --> 00:10:24,532
So I said I would,
and I booked the time in.

190
00:10:24,532 --> 00:10:25,682
Have you ever done that?

191
00:10:25,682 --> 00:10:26,882
You get near of that time

192
00:10:26,882 --> 00:10:29,362
and you think,
"What have I let myself in for here?"

193
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,772
"Will I be able to do it?"

194
00:10:30,772 --> 00:10:33,772
I thought, "What could I
do with them?" you see.

195
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:37,882
"I know. I'll do my cartoon drawing.
They'll like that."

196
00:10:37,882 --> 00:10:40,802
But then, as I got near of the time,
I got more apprehensive,

197
00:10:40,802 --> 00:10:42,162
because then I was thinking,

198
00:10:42,162 --> 00:10:44,662
"I've worked with children,
with all sorts of adults;

199
00:10:44,662 --> 00:10:46,672
I've never worked with a group like this."

200
00:10:46,672 --> 00:10:50,512
It turns out it was all part
of a charity called TALK.

201
00:10:50,512 --> 00:10:55,492
This TALK charity is a wonderful charity
that helps people who've suffered strokes,

202
00:10:55,492 --> 00:10:59,492
but have a particular condition
known as aphasia.

203
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,062
You might have heard of aphasia,
sometimes called dysphasia.

204
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:07,252
The key thing is it affects
their ability to communicate.

205
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:09,512
So, for example, they might have trouble

206
00:11:09,512 --> 00:11:13,062
reading, writing, speaking,
or understanding.

207
00:11:13,062 --> 00:11:16,292
It can be quite an isolating condition;

208
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:20,642
it can be very, very frustrating
and can lead to a loss of confidence.

209
00:11:20,642 --> 00:11:24,772
Anyway, so I prepared all this stuff,
what to do for this session

210
00:11:24,772 --> 00:11:27,132
- for a couple of hours,
tea break in the middle -

211
00:11:27,132 --> 00:11:29,962
and I got more apprehensive.

212
00:11:29,962 --> 00:11:31,832
But actually, I needn't have worried,

213
00:11:31,832 --> 00:11:34,542
because I'm going to show you now
the work that they did.

214
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:37,292
It was one of the best things
I've ever done.

215
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:39,754
I'm going to show you the first slide.

216
00:11:39,754 --> 00:11:42,644
I taught them Spike,
just like I did for you,

217
00:11:42,644 --> 00:11:46,204
and I want you to see the reaction
on their faces when they did this.

218
00:11:46,745 --> 00:11:49,505
(Audience) Oh.

219
00:11:49,505 --> 00:11:52,065
What you can see here
are two of the stroke recoverers

220
00:11:52,065 --> 00:11:53,195
on the left and right,

221
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:55,505
and one of the volunteer
helpers in the center.

222
00:11:56,252 --> 00:12:00,602
Each stroke recoverer, there are about 36
in the room with volunteers as well,

223
00:12:00,602 --> 00:12:02,812
there's one-to-one helpers.

224
00:12:02,812 --> 00:12:05,512
You can just see the delight
on their faces, can't you?

225
00:12:05,512 --> 00:12:07,732
Let's look at another picture.

226
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:12,056
This is a gentleman called David,
and he's holding up his picture,

227
00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:14,786
and you can tell it was the picture
of Spike, can't you?

228
00:12:14,786 --> 00:12:18,046
In fact, I think he's drawn Spike
even better there.

229
00:12:18,046 --> 00:12:21,536
But what I didn't realize
until even after the session

230
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:24,706
was that the number of the people
in this session, including David,

231
00:12:24,706 --> 00:12:27,246
were drawing with their wrong hand.

232
00:12:27,922 --> 00:12:31,752
David's stroke meant that it affected
the right side of his body,

233
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,542
and he drew with his left hand,
as many did.

234
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:37,232
Nobody mentioned it to me,
nobody complained.

235
00:12:37,232 --> 00:12:39,032
They just got on with it.

236
00:12:39,032 --> 00:12:41,172
It was an inspirational session for me.

237
00:12:41,172 --> 00:12:43,232
It was quite a humbling session,

238
00:12:43,232 --> 00:12:45,512
one of the best things
I felt I've ever done.

239
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:49,512
At the end of it, I had a lovely email
from doctor Mike Jordan,

240
00:12:49,512 --> 00:12:51,772
and he's the chair of the TALK group;

241
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,822
happens to be a medical doctor,
but he's the chair of the group.

242
00:12:54,822 --> 00:12:56,772
He wrote to me, and I'm quoting, he said,

243
00:12:56,772 --> 00:13:01,012
"Our recoverers learned today
that they can draw.

244
00:13:01,012 --> 00:13:02,532
It's a bit more than that;

245
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,792
this sort of activity
really builds their confidence."

246
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:08,542
So I was happy, he was happy,
everyone was happy,

247
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:09,972
they've invited me back again,

248
00:13:09,972 --> 00:13:13,062
and I go in there now
about every three or four months.

249
00:13:13,062 --> 00:13:16,112
So it's great. I thought
that was a lovely example to share.

250
00:13:16,112 --> 00:13:17,382
Fancy one more drawing?

251
00:13:17,382 --> 00:13:18,302
(Audience) Yes.

252
00:13:18,302 --> 00:13:20,502
Here we go. Grab your pens.

253
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:26,561
Here we go. Right.

254
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:29,521
I'm going to get you to draw someone
that you would recognize.

255
00:13:29,521 --> 00:13:34,021
So start with a big nose,
a bit like Spike's.

256
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:40,501
Next, we'll do some eyes,
and you might be thinking,

257
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:44,941
"This is also a bit like Spike."

258
00:13:44,941 --> 00:13:46,741
Watch the next bit.

259
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:53,061
You're getting warm.

260
00:13:56,956 --> 00:13:58,976
There you go.

261
00:14:00,754 --> 00:14:03,324
Little line down there.

262
00:14:04,986 --> 00:14:07,076
Down here.

263
00:14:07,076 --> 00:14:11,076
Little V-shape,
line to the left, line to the right.

264
00:14:11,076 --> 00:14:12,866
And you've got Albert Einstein.

265
00:14:12,866 --> 00:14:13,826
(Laughter)

266
00:14:13,826 --> 00:14:16,556
So you've got the pens with you,

267
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:21,006
you've proved that you can draw.

268
00:14:21,006 --> 00:14:23,106
You're very welcome
to take the pens with you

269
00:14:23,106 --> 00:14:24,506
and have a practice at home,

270
00:14:24,506 --> 00:14:25,676
even show somebody else.

271
00:14:25,676 --> 00:14:29,676
But actually, I'd like to leave you
with a final thought.

272
00:14:30,155 --> 00:14:32,265
When you walked in here today,

273
00:14:32,265 --> 00:14:35,205
many of you didn't believe
you could draw.

274
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:38,991
I've got a question for you about that.

275
00:14:38,991 --> 00:14:42,781
How many other beliefs
and limiting thoughts

276
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:46,491
do we all carry around with us every day?

277
00:14:46,491 --> 00:14:50,491
Beliefs that we could perhaps
potentially challenge

278
00:14:50,491 --> 00:14:52,791
and think differently about.

279
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,271
If we did challenge those beliefs
and think differently about them,

280
00:14:56,271 --> 00:15:00,691
apart from drawing, what else
would be possible for us all?

281
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,971
Thank you very much.

282
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:02,871
(Applause)
